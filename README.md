# SRF OCR Tool

> **Please Note:** This is not yet deployed and the OCR engines we’ve tried aren’t great at handwriting. They extract printed text well, but for more accurate handwritten transcription, consider purchasing a license of [Handwriting OCR](https://www.handwritingocr.com/) and integrating their API.
